<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What is inTouch?
Thanks to the smart phones and their internet services, our life get easier day by day. As a result of these improvements, it is possible to solve problems in terms of engineering and operational services with the help of applications that are accessed by smart phones. In this study, an application is developed to solve any problems of coordination and connection of the search and rescue teams and individuals who are suffering from catastrophic events. Location of users which are connected to system is identifying by the system as long as they allow their location and visualizing by Leaflet maps. Asynchronized web server tracks the location data of users and visualizes it in the real time scale. This work provides to users the capability of tracking their locations in regions where efficient GPS signals and internet connection are available.

## Folder structure
There's two different folders. Each of them is a Dart project.

* **core**: contains the pure Dart business logic, such API communication, Redux, XML parsing, sanitization, i18n, models and utilities. 
It also has a great test coverage.
* **ui**: this is the Flutter project. It imports **core**, and it's a 100% shared codebase for the native Android & iOS apps that go on app stores.
